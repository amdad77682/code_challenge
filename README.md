# Problem 1: (React Native/ React)

You need to create a music album using React Native (preferable)/ React. You can get music
album data from the following API endpoint:
Endpoint: http://rallycoding.herokuapp.com/api/music_albums
You need to display a list of albums in card view and do search any album with title through the
search box. Every card section will contain Header and Body. The header contains a thumbnail
image, title, and artist. The body contains the only image. You can find sample card design below:

<img width="289" alt="demo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23288785/57567524-4fd7b400-73fc-11e9-944a-2e5c9e6f6d3b.png">

You need to create react component to show albums and manage the state using redux
for searching the albumâ€™s title.

## Build in ios
